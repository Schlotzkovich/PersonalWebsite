    <p>
      Hi there! I'm a Hardware Support Supervisor at Sullivan and Cromwell, where I thrive on solving puzzles and thinking outside the box. My role isn't just about fixing issues—it's about empowering productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not at work, I’m immersed in tech—building PCs, exploring blockchain and AI, or tinkering with hardware and software. Occasionally, I fire up a video game to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      What drives me? A relentless curiosity and passion for learning. Though my journey wasn’t shaped by formal education, it’s fueled by discovery and an unshakable drive to explore the ever-evolving tech landscape.
