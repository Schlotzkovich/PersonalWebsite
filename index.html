    Hi there! I'm a Hardware Support Supervisor at Sullivan and Cromwell, where I thrive on solving puzzles, thinking outside the box, and ensuring end-users can work seamlessly. My role isn't just about fixing issues—it's about empowering productivity.

  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">
    When I'm not at work, you’ll find me deep in the world of technology—building custom PCs, exploring the potential of blockchain and AI, or experimenting with software and hardware. Sometimes, I’ll fire up a video game to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">
    What drives me? A relentless curiosity and passion for learning. While my path wasn’t shaped by formal education, I’ve carved a unique journey fueled by exploration, discovery, and an unshakable determination to understand the ever-evolving tech landscape.
