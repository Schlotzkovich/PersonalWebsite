    <p>
      Hi there! I'm the Hardware Support Supervisor at Sullivan and Cromwell, where I thrive on solving problems and thinking outside the box. My role is more than just fixing issues—it’s about empowering productivity every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I dive deep into tech projects, whether building custom PCs, exploring blockchain and AI, or tinkering with software and hardware. Occasionally, I play video games to sharpen my problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      What drives me? A passion for learning and an unrelenting curiosity. While I didn’t follow a traditional educational path, my journey is defined by discovery and a drive to master the ever-changing world of technology.
